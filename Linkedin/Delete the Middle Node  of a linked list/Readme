---

<p> You are given the <code>head</code> of a linked list. 
<strong>Delete</strong> the <strong>middle node</strong>, and return the <code>head</code> of the modified linked list.</p>

<p>The <strong>middle node</strong> of a linked list of size <code>n</code> is the <code>⌊n / 2⌋th</code> node 
from the <strong>start</strong> using <strong>0-based indexing</strong>, where <code>⌊x⌋</code> denotes the largest integer less than or equal to <code>x</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li> For `n` = `1,2,3,4, and 5,` the middle nodes are `0,1,1,2, and2,` respectively.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>


<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
<strong>Output:</strong>[1,3,4,1,2,6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node.

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

![Selecting last node]()

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [2,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of nodes in the list is in the range <code>[1, 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
<li><code>1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
